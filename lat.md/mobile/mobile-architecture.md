# Mobile architecture

Three layers, dependencies pointing inward: UI widgets depend on logic, logic on data and the domain, and the domain on nothing. The domain is the Dart package in `packages/domain`, shared with the service tier.

Created with `flutter create --org com.helpmebrands --project-name reward --platforms ios,android` and resolved through the root pub workspace (`resolution: workspace`), so one `dart pub get` covers the app, the domain and the service. iOS dependencies come through Swift Package Manager; there is no Podfile.

## Layers

The layout under `apps/mobile/lib/` follows Flutter's recommended architecture, with the domain kept outside the app entirely.

- **UI** (`lib/screens/`, `lib/widgets/`): Material widgets on the Nocturne tokens. No widget hard-codes a colour; every one is read from the theme extension. Every component ships with a Widget Preview.
- **Logic** (`lib/logic/`): view models and the app store, which call [[domain]] selectors and [[reminders|schedule construction]] and expose what a screen renders.
- **Data** (`lib/data/`): persistence of the single `AppData` snapshot and, later, the api client. Nothing above this layer knows where a snapshot lives.
- **Domain** (`packages/domain`): the rules, imported as `package:domain/domain.dart`.

## Theme

`nocturneTheme(Brightness)` builds a Material 3 `ThemeData` from the [[design#Tokens and theming|Nocturne tokens]], one per brightness, and carries the full token set as a `ThemeExtension` so widgets read tones and surfaces by name.

The dark tokens are Nocturne verbatim; the light tokens are the PWA's derived light theme, copied from `apps/pwa/src/styles/tokens.css` so both apps render the same colours. Where Nocturne and Material disagree on looks, Nocturne wins: `ColorScheme.primary` is the accent, primary actions are outlined, the surfaces are the three Nocturne grounds, and there is no alarm red. Material supplies compact density and 48dp minimum targets. The app follows the platform brightness through `ThemeMode.system`; pinned by [[mobile-tests#Theme]].
